    Bugfix: RSSI protocol module 'push' with absolute timeout would
            pop from underlying queue instead of pushing.

    Fix:    test driver for streams over unreliable transport should use
            some margin of acceptable errors. This was set to 22% (builder
            API) but when the same test was run with a YAML hierarchy the
            corresponding option was not set to relax the acceptable error
            margin.

    Bugfix: path was clobbered (incorrect NELMS) during 'explore' if tail
            was an array.

    Bugfix: protocol stack builder always used depacketizer if no SRP

    Bugfix: (jira ESLCOMMON-178) when loading an IntField config from
            YAML and the IntField has an enum menu then providing numerical
            values in the config file didn't work.

    Bugfix: proto_stack_builder::useDepack() should not set other params

    Feature: derive IStream from IEntry; allows to obtain
             basic properties from the stream interface.
